# BiteAndContourMapper---Phase2
Expanding upon the foundation laid in phase1, this project introduces dynamic maze construction with connections and advanced pathfinding capabilities. Using Qt and C++, it explores algorithms for shortest paths, minimal bites, and uphill traversal in a grid-based visualization of bites and contours.
